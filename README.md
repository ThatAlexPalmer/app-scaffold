# Frontend Scaffold for Poet and TAP

This is a frontend scaffold for Poet and TAP. It helps us quickly setup new landings pages and frontends for our projects.

## Features

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and structure using `DefaultTheme` and semantically meaningful components
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Next Sitemap](https://next-sitemap.lamvishnusankar.com) for generating sitemaps

## Development

Clone this template using shallow depth. Then install dependencies

yarn install
```

Then run the development server

You can also build and run the production server, which will generate next sitemap as well as run all checks.
